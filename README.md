# D417: Network Automation and Deployment – Student ID 004862484

This repository contains the automation solution for **Part I** of the D417 Performance Assessment at Western Governors University (WGU). The project demonstrates VLAN automation and network inventory generation using Python and YAML, as well as Git-based version control.

## Project Contents

- `switch_inventory.py` – Python script that generates an inventory YAML file with device general and network settings.
- `switch_inventory_<timestamp>.yml` – Ansible-compatible inventory file generated by the script.
- `pip-list.txt` – Screenshot or text export verifying installed Python libraries (netmiko, paramiko, etc.).
- Supporting screenshots – Terminal output showing execution, timestamps, and lab environment setup.

## Task Alignment

This repository fulfills the following assessment requirements for **Part I: VLAN Deployment Automation**:

- **Task A** – Verification of Python libraries used for VLAN automation.
- **Task B** – Python-based inventory collection for switches in Access Closet 1.
- **Task C (in progress)** – Python scripts for identifying and deploying VLANs.
- **Task D** – Documentation of the automation process (submitted separately as `.docx`).
